Consider consistency for the exercises

- Is there a style guide the language itself?
- Are these styles encouraged or enforced?
- Are there any conventions that we should adopt on this language track for the sake of consistency?
- Can we enforce these?
- Is there a linter? Are there many? Should we use one?
- Is there a common convention for filenames? If not, what should our convention be?

Note that this is about the exercises (the test suites and code examples), not people's solutions.
